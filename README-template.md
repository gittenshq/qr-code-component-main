## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I was able to become more familiar with my workflow. Instead of jumping around I focused more on an "order" of how I begin. I do need more practice but that's what this is all about.


### Continued development

I would like to focus on the fundementals when it comes to my approach. I tend to jump around and not use the right code where it would fit best.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me organize my thoughts and put my code where it would work better. It also helped as a refresher for older lessons I had learned before.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - MDN was handy when I was looking to use flexbox towards the end. I just couldn't quite remember to adjust the flex direction. Great reminder.
